Welcome to Myplate.com! A web app created for all the food lovers out there! You can create, read and delete a Meal Post. The Meal input form will take in the location, caption, and image address of your meal.  Once submitted you will be directed to the Meals Index Page, here you can view all the Meal Posts and also delete a Meal Post. 

To get started, lets fire up the backend to see the yummy posts waiting to be seen clone: https://github.com/Kiki1022/my-plate-backend.git, in the terminal:

    1. Run 'Bundle Install'
    2. Then type 'rails s' to get the server running.
    3. You can visit localhost:3000/api/v1/meals to see the json view of the Meals Index page.

Now to get the front end running in a seperate terminal clone: https://github.com/Kiki1022/my-plate-frontend.git
